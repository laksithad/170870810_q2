      With my steeped tea double double in hand. I made my way to the library.
      <br>
      After making many laps around each floor of the library, I was fortunate enough to find a spot
      in the mess that is exam season.

      After many hours of studying, I began to grow hungry. With food on my mind, I set out to
      <br>
      find some food. On my way out of the library I did my usual "phone, wallet, keys" check.
      <br>
      With that, I noticed that I did not have my keys so I spent an hour retracing my steps in the library
      <br>
      and throughout the campus searching high and low for my keys.
