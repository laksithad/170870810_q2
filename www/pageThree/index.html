      After making a call to the Special Constable and to the Tim Horton's, the search for my keys
      <br>
      came to an unfortunate end when I was unable to find my keys. Defeated, I went home and paid to
      <br>
      get my door open by management.

      The next day, I started my day as usual with Tim Horton's. In a last attempt,
      <br>
      I asked the worker if they have found keys. To my suprise, the worker came back
      <br>
      with my keys! I was over joyed.

      When I called the the store earlier, the worker said they have not found keys but found a can opener.
      <br>
      I guess he thought the fob and chain that I had was a can opener.. TBH he owes me 50$ because that's
      <br>
      how much it costed to open my door.
